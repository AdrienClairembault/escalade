# escalade

This GLPI plugin aims to simplifier the ticket escalation process in GLPI.
It also adds a graphical historical for assigned groups.
A new dashboard on the user's home page is added, and a new criteria in ticket's search engine.

To finish, there's also a clone ticket feature, accessible through an icon on the ticket form.
